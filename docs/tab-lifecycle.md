## Tab lifecycle

Use these methods in `js`, awaiting every call. Start with `await browser.nameSession('🔎 Research')`, then `let tab = await browser.tabs.new(url)`. Agent-created tabs open in a named Chrome group, in the background, muted until the user looks at them.

To use an existing tab, call `await browser.user.openTabs({query:'…',limit:20})`, then `let tab = await browser.user.claimTab({tabId})`. Discovery is recency-sorted, defaults to 20 matches and is capped at 100; it is not a complete browser inventory. To claim the foreground tab, use `{active:true}`. Unique URL/title lookup is also supported; `expectedUrl` and `expectedTitle` check exact identity when necessary. Claiming alone does not observe the page. Claimed user tabs stay outside the agent group and are never closed by finalize.

`await browser.tabs.list()` returns controlled tabs with string `id`, numeric Chrome `tabId`, `origin` and `state`. Obtain a handle with `await browser.tabs.get(id)`. The page id is stable across navigation and becomes stale after closure. An older extension may return `pending:true` without an id; match its numeric `tabId` on a later list call. Unknown ids are rejected rather than adopted.

`await tab.release()` keeps the tab open and gives up control; an agent-created tab also leaves the group and is unmuted. `await tab.close()` closes a controlled tab. For bulk user-tab cleanup, use `await browser.user.closeTabs([tabId1,tabId2])` without claiming; its result reports `closed` and `failed` ids. Keep discovery and planning in REPL variables, and return a summary before the next decision. Do not move every row into the conversation.

Finish with the MCP tool `session_finalize`, or `await browser.tabs.finalize({keep:[{tab,status:'deliverable'}]})` in `js`. `deliverable` tabs leave the group and stay open; `handoff` tabs stay grouped for a later turn; other agent tabs close. Failed tabs retain their lease for retry. After successful finalize, old handles are released; obtain fresh handles in a later turn. Let running JavaScript finish before calling the separate finalize tool.

Resetting JavaScript leaves browser tabs open. The stdio launcher finalizes on disconnect; direct HTTP clients should call `session_finalize` or `DELETE /session`. An idle browser session is finalized after an hour.
