# Releasing opencli-mcp

The npm package and Chrome extension have separate versions. Each npm release also attaches the current key-bearing extension build as a manual-install zip to GitHub Releases. Update the Chrome Web Store extension separately when extension code changes.

## One-time npm setup

In the [opencli-mcp npm package settings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencli-mcp), add a **Trusted Publisher** for GitHub Actions:

- GitHub owner: `jackwener`
- Repository: `opencli-mcp`
- Workflow filename: `release.yml`
- Environment: leave blank

The workflow uses GitHub OIDC to publish to npm. It does not need an `NPM_TOKEN` secret. GitHub Actions must be enabled for this repository.

## Each release

1. Commit and push the changes you want to release to `main`.
2. Open [Actions → Release npm package and manual extension](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli-mcp/actions/workflows/release.yml), choose **Run workflow** on `main`, and enter an unused version such as `0.0.20`.
3. Optionally enter release notes. If omitted, the workflow uses commit subjects since the previous tag. An existing `CHANGELOG.md` section for that version takes precedence.

The workflow updates `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md`, runs a small set of checks, builds and installs the tarball, validates that the extension's public key produces the ID allowed by the native host, commits the release version, pushes its tag, publishes to npm with provenance, creates a GitHub Release with the tarball and manual-install extension zip, and waits for npm to expose the version. Re-run the same version if publication or release creation fails after the tag was pushed; it checks the existing tag and package instead of bumping again.

The manual-install zip keeps `manifest.key` and is meant to be extracted and loaded through Chrome's **Load unpacked**. The `npm run pack:store` zip removes that key and is only for Web Store upload. Do not use the store zip for manual installation. The extension manifest version is independent of the npm package version.
